# The-Jazz-Machine
Uses Andrej Karparthy's RNN and a custom modified CSV files to generate jazz music.

Converted MIDI files into CSV files via a tool, then converted the CSV files into my custom text files, 
which were significantly smaller and focused than the CSV files. These custom files were fed into the neural net. 
The output file was then converted via script back into CSV, then MIDI. MIDI is playable format.

Sadly, the music is pretty bad right now so no sample files.
